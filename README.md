# Machine Learning - Andrew Ng (Implementation in Python)
## In this repository, I finished all homeworks of Machine Learning Course
### 1. Linear Regression
- This exercise covers linear regression with multiple variables.
### 2. Logistic Regression
- This exercise covers logistic regression which is a method for classification problems.
- It also covers the application of logistic regression to multi-class classification.
### 3. Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks
- This exercise covers Neural Networks which is a model inspired by how our brain works
### 4. Neural Networks Learning
- Learning how to train Neural Networks will be covered in this exercise.
- The "Backpropagation" algorithm will be implemented in this one.
### 5. Regularized Linear Regression and Bias_Variance
- Visualizing and detecting the perfomance of a learning algorithm will be included in this exercise.
- This exercise also covers debugging learning algorithm, improving its performance, and also how to deal with skewed data.
### 6. Support Vector Machines
This exercise covers the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm.
### 7. K-Means Clustering and PCA
- This exercise covers unsupervise learning algorithms which need only input (X).
- Unsupervise learning algorithm for this exercise is K-Mean Clustering and Principal Components Analysis (PCA).
### 8. Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems
- This exercise covers anomaly detection and recommender algorithm such as the collaborative filtering algorithm (another name is low-rank matrix factorization).
